# Hackdrone
Goal is to take a cheap ($50~100) commercially available quadcopter drone and throw a raspberry pi onto it to act as a pivot point. Overall price goal is  ~$100.

Initial milestone is to just get wifi/bluetooth capability and ssh into the device from a laptop and be able to do MITM attacks, network mapping, etc.

Longterm goal is LTE/GPS capability, solar power bank, remote on/off relay switch which would allow me to power the drone on and off from a remote location (to conserve power)
