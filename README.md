# Hackdrone
Goal is to take a cheap ($50~100) commercially available quadcopter drone and throw a raspberry pi onto it to act as a pivot point. Overall price goal is  ~$100.

Initial milestone is to just get wifi/bluetooth capability and ssh into the device from a laptop and be able to do MITM attacks, network mapping, etc. I might use the pi flavor of kali

Longterm goal is LTE/GPS capability, solar power bank, remote on/off relay switch which would allow me to power the drone on and off from a remote location (to conserve power). I'm looking at ways to possibly charge the drone's battery via solar so that I can park a drone on top of a location, leave it there and remote in from a different location. then a few days later I can go turn the drone on, fly it back to myself and leave.
